# Flashcards

This is the repository for my bachelor thesis. I am building a vocabulary learning app with [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli).

The app is deployed at [glitch](https://flashcards-pwa.glitch.me/).

## How to get started
Requirements: [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed.
To run the app use the commands below in your terminal.

``` bash
# To install dependencies run:
npm install

# To serve with hot reload at localhost:8080 run:
npm run dev

# To build for production with minification and own index.html template run:
preact build --template src/index.html

# To test the production build locally run:
npm run serve

# To run tests with jest and preact-render-spy run:
npm run test
```
