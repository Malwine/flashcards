# Flashcards

This is the repository for my bachelor thesis. I am building a vocabulary learning app with [preact-cli](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli).

## How to get started

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification and own template
preact build --template src/index.html

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy 
npm run test
```
